# Image-Converter
It was a great opportunity for me to work in this project with my co-coder,Miran and enhance my knowledge in python programming. This project is a menu driven Image converter which is used to resize an image, convert the image to black and white, sharpen the image and blur out the image. The code uses popular image processing libraries as opencv, pillow. the code is user friendly to a certain extend and is useful for processing the images. The image file location should be in the same folder as that of the code else you have to copy the path where the image is and update it in the code.
